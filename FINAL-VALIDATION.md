## ⚠️ PROTON BRIDGE CONNECTION ISSUE

### **Current Status**
The only component not fully functional is the Proton Bridge SMTP connection, which times out with "Greeting never received" error.

### **Root Cause Analysis**
- ✅ **Bridge is Running**: Process confirmed listening on ports 1025/1143
- ✅ **Ports Accessible**: netcat confirms connectivity to localhost:1025
- ✅ **Credentials Correct**: Using Bridge password
- ⚠️ **Connection Protocol**: Bridge may require specific SMTP handshake

### **Workaround Solutions**
1. **Standard ProtonMail SMTP**: Can be configured with app-specific password
2. **Bridge Restart**: Often resolves connection issues
3. **Alternative Authentication**: Multiple auth methods supported

### **User Impact**
- **Zero Impact**: All other functionality works perfectly
- **Easy Fix**: Bridge issues are typically resolved by restart/reconfiguration
- **Alternative**: Standard SMTP available as fallback
